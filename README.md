This work is a study case part of the eighth course ["Google Data Analytics Capstone"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone) of the ["Google Data Analyst"](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) program. 

Although it's no the first time that I had perform a data analysis, both at the academic and professional level, it's the first time following the methodology proposed in the study program, by serving the R programming language and the database query language (SQL).

Under normal circumstances, with the data we had from the start, _this work would not have been possible_, but I had priories on putting the skills learned into practice and carrying out this case study in a relatively short period of time, less than a week.
